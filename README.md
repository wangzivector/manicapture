# Affordable, Prototypable, and Versatile Manipulation Capture System for Robotic Manipulation

This repository presents a manipulation capture system designed to record detailed hand poses (**6D palm poses and finger joint configurations**) and tactile data (**distributed pad deformation and three-axis contact forces**) during human or robotic interaction with the environment. The entire system can be fabricated using widely accessible laboratory tools, including FDM 3D printing and flexible PCB manufacturing services. Remarkably, the cost of producing one hand prototype is extremely low, *totaling less than $100 USD*.
